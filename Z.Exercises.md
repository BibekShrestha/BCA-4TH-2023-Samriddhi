### Week 1-2: Introduction to Python and Programming Concepts
1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a temperature in Celsius and converts it to Fahrenheit. The formula for conversion is F = (C * 1.8) + 32.
	1. 1. Modify the program to find where Celsius and Fahrenheit have same value.
2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number and checks whether it is even or odd.
3. Write a program that prompts the user to enter two numbers and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
4. Write a program that takes a string input from the user and prints the string in reverse order.
5. Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and prints the list in reverse order.
6. Write a program that takes two lists as input and prints a new list containing only the common elements in both lists.
7. Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the sum of all the numbers in the list.

### Week 3-4: Functions and Modules
1. Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.
	1. add a third argument to the function that takes operation to perform on first two arguments ( addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
2. Write a program that uses the math module to calculate the square root of a number entered by the user.
3. Write a program that imports a custom module that contains a function to calculate the factorial of a number and uses that function to calculate the factorial of a number entered by the user.    
4. Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number entered by the user.
	1. using recursion
5. Write a program that reads a file containing a list of numbers and calculates their average.
6. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a string and a character and counts the number of occurrences of the character in the string.
7. Write a program that prompts the user to enter two numbers and finds their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm.
8. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a list of numbers and calculates their median (the middle number in a sorted list of numbers).

### Week 5-6: Data Structures and Algorithms
1. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a list of numbers and prints the largest and smallest numbers in the list.
2. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a string and counts the number of vowels in the string.
3. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a list of numbers and sorts the list in ascending order.
4. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a sentence and creates a dictionary with each word as a key and its frequency as a value.
5. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a string and checks whether it is a palindrome (a word, phrase, or sequence of letters that reads the same backward as forward).
6. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a list of numbers and calculates their average using recursion.
7. Write a program that prompts the user to enter two lists of numbers and merges them into a single sorted list.
8. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a list of words and sorts them by length (shortest to longest).
9. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a string and checks whether it contains only unique characters.
10. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a list of integers and finds the second largest number in the list.
11. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a list of integers and checks whether the list is sorted in ascending order.
12. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a list of integers and finds the sum of all the even numbers in the list.
13. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a string and counts the number of occurrences of each character in the string.
14. Write a program that takes a list of strings as input and prints the shortest string in the list.


### Week 7-8: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
1. Write a program that creates a class called Rectangle with attributes length and width and methods to calculate the perimeter and area of the rectangle.
2. Write a program that creates a class called Person with attributes name, age, and address and a method to print the person's details.
3. Write a program that creates a class called BankAccount with attributes account_number, balance, and owner_name and methods to deposit and withdraw money from the account.

### Week 9-10: Web Development with Python
1. Write a Flask application that displays a simple "Hello World" message on a webpage.
2. Write a Flask application that prompts the user to enter their name and displays a personalized greeting message on a webpage.
3. Write a Flask application that displays a list of items and allows the user to add or remove items from the list.

### Week 11-12: Data Analysis with Python

1. Write a program that reads a CSV file containing student grades and calculates the average, maximum, and minimum grades for each student.
2. Write a program that reads a CSV file containing stock prices and plots the data using Matplotlib.
3. Write a program that reads a CSV file containing customer orders and visualizes the data using a bar chart or pie chart using Seaborn.
